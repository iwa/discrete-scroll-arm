Fix for OS X's scroll wheel problem, with native support of Apple Silicon

## Installation

You may download the binary [here](https://github.com/emreyolcu/discrete-scroll/releases/download/v0.1.1u/DiscreteScroll.zip).<br/>
It runs in the background and allows you to scroll 3 lines with each tick of the
wheel.

If it ask you to allow accessibility access, open `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility` then check `DiscreteScroll`.

It needs to be run each time you boot. If you want this to be automatic you
may go to `System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items` and add
`DiscreteScroll` to the list. If you want to undo the effect you may launch
Activity Monitor, search for `DiscreteScroll` and force it to quit.
